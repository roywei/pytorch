oneDNN Graph Library is an Intel implementation of oneDNN Graph API. oneDNN
Graph API, previously also known as Low Level Graph API (LLGA), is a graph API
which extends oneDNN with a unified high-level graph API for multiple AI
hardware classes (CPU, GPU and accelerators). oneDNN Graph API accepts deep
learning computation graph as input and performs graph partitioning, where nodes
that are candidates for fusion are grouped together.
