oneAPI Deep Neural Network Library (oneDNN) Graph API
===========================================

This branch is to propose a preview for the graph API extension to oneDNN.
oneDNN Graph API extends oneDNN with a unified high-level graph API for multiple
AI hardware classes (CPU, GPU, accelerators). With a flexible graph interface,
it maximizes the optimization opportunity for generating efficient code across a
variety of Intel and non-Intel hardwares, and can be closely integrated with
ecosystem frameworks and inference engines.

The goal of the preview branch is to:

* Collect feedback on the API design, not the implementation.
* Demonstrateâ€¯the programming model of oneDNN Graph API.
* Show ease of use of the API for framework integration.
* Provide product-level quality support to early adoption before merging to
  oneDNN master branch.

The current API version aims to work with the framework graph and identify graph
partitions to offload. The partition will be further compiled and executed as a
fused operation in the framework graph. To support aggressive operation fusion
and achieve the best performance, oneDNN Graph implementation includes a
low-level graph compiler, also known as oneDNN Graph compiler.

Enabling oneDNN Graph compiler doesn't result in any change to its programming
model, Graph API users can choose to turn on or off graph compiler during build
or installation of oneDNN Graph.

## Documentation

[Public specification](https://spec.oneapi.com/onednn-graph/latest/index.html)
on oneAPI SPEC website explains the design, programming model, and operation set
of oneDNN Graph API.

In the doc folder of this branch, [an overview introduction](doc/README.md) to
oneDNN Graph API is provided along with two tutorials on how to use the API:
[CPU version](doc/programming_model/cpu_programming.md) and [SYCL
version](doc/programming_model/sycl_get_started.md).

Developer guide and API reference of this branch can be generated from source
code. Public webpages are still under construction.

## System Requirements

oneDNN Graph supports platforms based on the following architectures:

* [Intel 64 or AMD64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64)

## Requirements for Building from Source

oneDNN Graph supports systems meeting the following requirements:

* Operating system with Intel 64 and Arm 64 architecture support
* C++ compiler with C++11 standard support
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) 2.8.12 or later
* [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/download.html#srcbin) 1.8.5 or later to build
  the documentation

Configurations of CPU and GPU engines may introduce additional build time
dependencies.

  Beta

### Typical Build Steps

To build the library from source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oneapi-src/oneDNN.git --branch dev-graph-alpha --recursive
cd oneDNN
mkdir build && cd build
cmake .. -DDNNL_GRAPH_BUILD_TESTS=1 -DDNNL_GRAPH_BUILD_EXAMPLES=1
make -j
```

To validate the library with tests and examples:

```bash
cd build
ctest -V
```

To install the built library, you need to have the write privilege of the target
directory with sudo or specifying the target directory via
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` in the cmake command line.

```bash
make install
```

To build on Windows, see [Build from Source](./doc/build/build.md#Windows).
